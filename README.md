# ðŸ“Œ Information Retrieval Project
> A Python-based search engine implementing Vector Space and deep-learning retrieval models.

## ðŸ“œ About
This project develops an Information Retrieval (IR) system capable of efficiently processing and ranking text documents. It integrates both traditional and deep-learning-based retrieval models for relevance ranking.

Key Features:
- **Document Preprocessing**: Stopword removal, stemming, and tokenization using NLTK.
- **Inverted Indexing**: Mapping terms to document occurrences for fast retrieval.
- **Vector Space Model (VSM)**: Computing TF-IDF weights (two schemes) and ranking documents via cosine similarity.
- **Deep-Learning Retrieval**: Integrating ColBERT (pretrained transformer-based model) via Google Colab for contextualized query ranking.
